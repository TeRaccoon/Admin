which delivery scheduled for today. Basically the dashboard...

add invoice item

calculate the total of the invoice item and add to current the invoice it applies to









Do the net after the discount
VAT is 20% of final
net -> total -> vat -> total








    $discount = handle_data($conn, "ASSOC", "SELECT discount FROM customers WHERE id = '".$customer_id."'", "discount");
    $vat_modifier = 0;
    $total_modifier = 0;
    $net_value_modifier = 0;
    if ($reset) {
        $net_value_modifier = handle_data($conn, "ASSOC", "SELECT (ii.quantity * i.list_price) AS item_invoice_total FROM items_invoiced AS ii INNER JOIN items AS i ON ii.item_id WHERE i.id = '".$invoice_item_id."'", "item_invoice_total");
        $total_modifier = $net_value_modifier * 1.2;
        $vat_modifier = $total_modifier - $net_value_modifier;
    }
    //ADD CHECK TO SEE IF INVOICE ITEM HAS VAT CHARGE
    $invoice_values = get_invoice_value($conn, $item_data, $discount); // Net, total, VAT
    var_dump($invoice_values);
    $conn->query("UPDATE invoices SET total = '".($invoice_values[1] - $total_modifier)."', VAT = '".($invoice_values[2] - $vat_modifier)."', net_value = '".($invoice_values[0] - $net_value_modifier)."' WHERE id = '".$item_data['invoice_id'][0]."'");
    
    $customer_debt = handle_data($conn, "ASSOC", "SELECT SUM(total) AS total FROM invoices WHERE customer_id = '".$customer_id."' AND payment_status = 'No'", "total");    
    $conn->query("UPDATE customers SET outstanding_balance = '".$customer_debt."' WHERE id = '".$customer_id."'");

    setItemTotalSold($conn, $item_data, false);    


    so for example. A customer has an invoice for £400. They pay £500. 
    The payment is linked to a specific invoice so even if they had another invoice that needed paying they couldnt assign it. 
    Unless I create a new payment entry with no invoice ID that just has a reference of "credit". 
    Then when a customer goes to make another payment it can sum the total of all their credits and use that instead?
